<p>This page outlines the privacy policy of Hemlock and related apps for iOS ("the app"):
* [C/W MARS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cwmars)
* [PINES (Georgia)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kenstir.apps.pines)
</p>
<h1>Reason for Collection</h1>
<p>The app collects general data on which features are used and how
often.  For example, if you place a hold, an event is collected noting
whether you chose email and/or SMS notification.  In the event of a
crash, a stack trace is collected, along with some details about the
hardware and software on the phone, and some logs about the network
requests made leading up to the crash.</p>

<p>This information allows us to fix bugs, and improve and prioritize features.</p>
